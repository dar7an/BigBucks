For the upcoming sprint, we plan to continue making progress on our backlog, focusing on developing the ability for the user to leverage charting capabilties on their functional portfolio page. We want to add the ability to not only view statistics like efficient frontier or an optimal portfolio, but also the ability to chart indexes vs certain owned stock prices and many others. To do this, we are building out how our system will handle api calls to alphavantage to make sure we have the most recent data for these statistics. Along with that we are going to start building out our analytic and UI/UX interface and develop how our wireframe implementation will go to incorporate everything we want.
