For the upcoming sprint 6, we plan to continue making progress on our backlog and wrapping up many requirements of the projects. First, we will implement the remaining three charts on the portfolio metrics page to allow users to better understand their portfolio. Then, we will flesh out the admin functionality by creating more comprehensive summary metrics. To validate many of our functionalities, we will also focus on adding a variety of test cases and error handling measures to address any edge cases or inputs from the user. Lastly, we will touch up the UI/UX to match our designs and create a plished overall system, and clean up other small aspects of the different user pages.
