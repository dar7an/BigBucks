In sprint 6, we met near the beginning of the week to assess the current status of our BigBucks system and make a plan for the week. After documenting everything we knew we needed to accomplish we met with the TA to address how we would go about this and what she expected from our final remianing requirements. From here we delegated the assignments to each person and addressed what was most nesseacry first. After that we focused on more nice to have elements and once we had everything exactly how we wanted and our documentation/test cases in place, we focused on recording our videos and preparing for the final presentation.
