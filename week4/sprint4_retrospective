In our latest sprint, we made substantial progress by completing key features that enhance our investment platform's functionality and user experience. We introduced a user portfolio display, enabling active market engagement through new 'buy' and 'sell' features, and improved stock management with detailed listings. The completion of a paper prototype for our UI/UX design sets the stage for more refined visual planning. Moving forward, we're excited to focus on developing a wireframe prototype, implementing extensive data storage for analytics, and introducing sophisticated statistical tools and charting capabilities.
