Proximity

The proximity principle was applied to organize elements that are functionally related, enhancing user understanding and navigation. For example, in the portfolio view, individual stocks along with their respective statistics and charting options are placed closely together. This grouping naturally suggests a relationship among the items, making it easier for users to process information related to their investments efficiently.

Similarity

We used the similarity principle to create a cohesive design language throughout the platform. By designing buttons, links, and interactive elements with consistent visual cues such as color, shape, and typography, users can quickly identify actionable items across the login, trade execution, and portfolio pages. This consistency reduces cognitive load, allowing users to navigate and interact with the platform more intuitively.

Common Region

Leveraging the common region principle, we visually grouped related elements within defined boundaries. For instance, the trade execution section on the trading page is visually separated from the rest of the content, using a distinct border. This visual enclosure helps users focus on the task at hand, whether buying or selling, by indicating that these elements are part of a coherent functional group.

Continuity

The principle of continuity is evident in the layout and navigational flow of the platform. We designed the user journey—from logging in, to navigating to the trade section, and finally reviewing the portfolio—to follow a logical and uninterrupted path. Visual elements such as navigation bars and directional cues ensure that users experience a smooth transition between tasks, maintaining their orientation and focus throughout their interaction with the platform.
