In our latest sprint, we met at the outset to review recent achievements and strategize forthcoming tasks. We developed a user portfolio display page, enhancing user engagement by allowing visibility into their investment activities. We successfully implemented functionalities allowing users to 'buy' shares with their USD account at current market prices and 'sell' owned shares for USD, following market rules. Additionally, we crafted a feature to list stocks owned by users, displaying critical information like ticker symbols, names, and share quantities. A pivotal part of this sprint was completing a paper prototype for our UI/UX design, setting a clear direction for the platform's visual and user interaction elements. Moreover, we focused on building out a functional portfolio page, making it easier for users to track their investments, view performance data, and make informed decisions. These advancements have substantially elevated the platform's functionality and user experience, laying a robust foundation for future enhancements and closer alignment with our project goals.
