In sprint 3, we developed some key tools for the BigBucks application, like buying and selling stocks, searching stocks, and seeing stock details. These were important steps that will help lay the foundation for upcoming work in sprint 4. Developing user portfolios will allow us to begin working on some of the analysis and plotting tools to offer users. While working on these tasks in sprint 3, some challenges we faced were making our functionalities sync with our database, and entering and retrieving the necessary information when needed. The database is the core data center for our application, so it is important that we can effectively store information in an organized way and be able to access it easily from different parts of our system.
