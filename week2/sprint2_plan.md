For our next week of work we plan to continue to follow our product backlog, focusing mainly on developing an account creation page that allows for log-in/log-out functionality for our website and building out our home page application along with setting up our API connections to alpha vantage. We also hope to set up our virtual machine in the following week and connect our already completed database to it. We plan to meet again at our same time with the TA and our same weekly meetings to go over task status and plans going forward.
