In sprint 5, we met near the beginning of the week to assess the current status of our BigBucks system and make a plan for the week. After doing some extensive work on the UI/UX mockups in the previous sprint, we began by making many user interface changes to the home, buy/sell, portfolio, and account pages to match the planned designs. Then, we focused on implementing admin functionality by creating a different experience for site visitors with "admin" role, where they can see summarized data about the transactions and holdings of users in the system. Lastly, we began working on a number of different portfolio metrics to display to users so they can better understand the performance of their holdings. We implemented the efficient frontier calculations, Sharpe ratios, and displaying historic price data for different stocks.
