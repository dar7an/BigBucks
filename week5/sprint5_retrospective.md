This past sprint, we made solid progress on many of the requirements by completing key features related to admin functionality, portfolio metrics, and UI/UX design. This was important for our team, as the finish lines is now within reach, and the number of requirements left to implement feels tangible. The toughest part of this previous sprint was the efficient frontier implementation, as it required some difficult calculations and code implementation, but it was a satisfying feeling to finally get it completed. We are feeling good about the state of our BigBucks system, and confident we can complete the final portfolio charts, UI/UX edits, and tests/error handling in a timely manner.
