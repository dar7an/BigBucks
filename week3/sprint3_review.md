In this past sprint, we met early in the week to recap what we had recently completed, and make a plan for the work to be completed during the week. For the project, we further developed our user account functionality by beginning work on an account page where users can view settings and make changes to their profile. Also, we implemented the critical functionality to buy and sell stock, including getting the most recent price, checking for the necessary balance, and updating the necessary database tables. Additionally, we added a stock search tool so users can view up-to-date details about a specific stock. In doing these tasks, we gained a stronger understanding of the upcoming requirements for the project and how we will approach them.
