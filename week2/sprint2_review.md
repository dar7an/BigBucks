In this sprint we met to go over how we would delegate tasks and also work on a couple projects together that we felt were better to complete together. We worked together to develop a database schema that made sense to everyone and was something we could successfully implement and build off of. We then broke up tasks to create the initial repository, build out the SQL tables for the schema, and make adjustments to our UML class diagrams and use cases. We have yet to deploy and set up our VCM so the DORA metrics will not be applicable until next week.
