We successfully met as a group to go over how we were moving forward from this point. Our meeting was successful as there was a good understanding of what projects we needed done and agreement overall on how we were going to organize our program's architecture and which tasks would come first. We didn't nessecarily run into any struggles this week as most of our work was agreed upon before hand and laid out through our product backlog.
