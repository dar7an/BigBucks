In our latest sprint, we met at the start to review recent achievements and discuss forthcoming tasks. We developed a user portfolio display page, enhancing user engagement by allowing visibility into their investment activities. We successfully implemented functionalities allowing users to 'buy' shares with their USD account at current market prices and 'sell' owned shares for USD, following market rules. Additionally, we crafted a feature to list stocks owned by users, displaying critical information like ticker symbols, names, and share quantities. We also developed a paper prototype for our UI/UX design, setting a clear direction for the platform's visual and user interaction elements. Along with this, we focused on building out a functional portfolio page, making it easier for users to track their investments, view performance data, and make informed decisions.
