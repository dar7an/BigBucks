Definition of Done 
For any piece of work to be considered "Done," it must satisfy the following criteria, aligned with the PSP script stages and tailored to our project's specifics:

Planning:

Requirements are fully understood and documented.
Tasks are created and estimated in the issue tracker, with dependencies identified.
Design:

A design document is created for the feature, including architectural decisions, data models, and interaction flows, reviewed and approved by the team.
Development:

Code is implemented following project coding standards and practices.
Unit tests are written for all new logic, achieving a predetermined coverage threshold.
Code Review:

The code is peer-reviewed, and any identified issues are addressed. The review process checks for code quality, adherence to design, and potential performance issues.
Testing:

Integration testing is completed, and the feature works as expected within the system.
Any bugs identified during testing are fixed, and regression testing confirms the fixes.
Documentation:

Relevant documentation is updated or added, including inline code comments, README updates, and external documentation for users or contributors.
Deployment:

The code is merged into the main branch after all checks pass.
The feature is deployed to a staging environment for final verification.
Final Verification:

Product Owner or designated team member confirms the feature meets all requirements and functions as expected in the staging environment.
Feedback Incorporation:

Feedback from the final verification stage is incorporated, if necessary, and verified.
